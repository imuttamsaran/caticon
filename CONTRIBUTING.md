Welcome to catIcon
Welcome!

Before diving into catIcon, have a look at our mission:

We are a community of developers pushing more open sources svg icons processes and improving the design of catIcon library.

There are a couple of important words there to keep in mind before exploring catIcon.

Community: catIcon is first and foremost a community of people. We chat in our forum, and we work on projects together on GitHub. There is a very loose hierarchy, but it's largely based on how long you've been involved in the group. People who have been here longer know how the community works and operates. If you want to learn more about the rules we have formulated over time, check out our by-laws and our code of conduct.
Designers and developers: A lot of us come from all over the spectrum. Some of us are designers, ux-researchers, front-end developers, visual designers, graphic designers, back-end developers, the list goes on, but we're all united by our mission.
Open Source: Open source is a catch all term for what is generally known as Free, Libre, and Open Source Software. But some of us focus on more than software. The word "open" is key here.
There are different ways to contribute to catIcon. How to best contribute will depend upon your skill set. However, it is important to determine if you want to contribute to the catIcon project itself and/or our community, or if you want to contribute design related resources.
