## 🚨 Important for Contributors & Supporters

> ⚠️ **Please read carefully before contributing**

### ✏️ Editable Code Format (Only edit the red part as shown below)

\`\`\`html
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1.5rem" height="1.5rem" fill="currentColor" class="catIcon" viewBox="0 0 16 16">
  <path d="add path here" />
</svg>
\`\`\`


- DO NOT change any class names, IDs, or SVG structure unless you're told to.
- Only edit the \`<path>\` tag or the actual \`d\` attribute.

## 🗂 Where to Add Icons

Place your SVG files in the \`svgIcon/\` directory.

**Example:**

\`\`\`
svgIcon/
  ├── activity.svg
  ├── airplay.svg
  └── your-icon-name.svg ← (Add yours here)
\`\`\`

✅ Use lowercase \`kebab-case\` filenames like \`message-circle.svg\`.
